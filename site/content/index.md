Hi, I am Ryan (he/him), a Cyber Security & Networks student from [Glasgow Caledonian University](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/). My key interests lie in the fields of **network administration, optimisation, and security**. Currently, I'm looking for work placement opportunities for Fall 2025.

My career goal is to pursue a Master's in my field of interests. I'm working with [Dr. Rajiv Singh](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/staff/mosesaprofinashawa/rajivsingh) on my undergraduate project regarding **OTA firmware deployments in smart home IoT ecosystems**.

I'm training as a Network Engineer with [WorldSkills UK](https://www.worldskillsuk.org/). WorldSkills's work is important since it helps young people worldwide achieve **world-class** standards through competitions-based training and assessment. By participating in this global movement, I'm developing skills that not only enhance my professional growth but also contribute to driving innovation, investment, and economic growth in the UK.

During my undergraduate life, I actively pursued opportunities that allowed me to develop both academically and personally. My involvement in various **IT and networking competitions** helped me refine my technical skills, culminating in being selected as a **member of the IT-NSA Squad UK** from 2022 to 2026. I earned a *Medallion of Excellence* at the 2022 WorldSkills UK competition, and in 2023, I represented Team UK at WorldSkills Asia.

I’m an ***adaptive learner* with a *strong work ethic***, always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. With experience in both leadership roles and team settings across academic and personal projects, I strive to give my best in every responsibility I take on.

## Research
### Optimising an OTA Firmware Deployment System for Smart Home IoT Devices
#### Undergraduate Thesis 
Supervisor: [Dr. Rajiv Singh](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/staff/mosesaprofinashawa/rajivsingh)

[GitHub](https://github.com/ryancranie/) | [Proposal]() | [Thesis]()

In this study, we aim to exploit the lack of security within smart home network infrastructure, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities in over-the-air firmware updates for IoT devices.

## Projects
### Dijhitech Research Labs: Internal Penetration Test
#### Applied Penetration Testing: Graded Group Project

[Report of Findings](cw.pdf)

For our university project, we conducted a black-box penetration test in a simulated environment. The final report offers a detailed analysis of nine vulnerabilities identified, along with recommended remediations for each. This project also provided valuable leadership experience, as I took responsibility for task delegation and organizing team meetings. I was fortunate to collaborate with a talented group of classmates throughout the process.

## Hobbies

### Game Dev
I've recently started developing a 2D puzzle platformer called *Watson* using **Unreal Engine 5**. It's a collaborative project with my partner—I'm responsible for all the programming, while she handles the art. This project has been a great way to combine our skills and creativity, and has helped me grow in game development. We’ve focused on creating unique mechanics and an engaging visual style, drawing inspiration from games like **Stardew Valley** and **Celeste**.

### osu! 
As a passionate osu! player, I’ve consistently demonstrated commitment and skill, reaching rank **#1 UK** and **#22 global**. I've also represented the UK in the *osu! World Cup* in 2022, 2023, and 2024, and have captained numerous international osu! eSports teams. Here is my entire [osu! Tournament History](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBgSICMBy7sX5WguMKX24nkigxztNbxOPuGN8INef1k/edit?gid=1150041730#gid=1150041730). I take pride in my achievements and aim to inspire others with my performance.

### Badminton
Badminton has always been my favorite sport, and I actively pursued it throughout high school, representing two of the three high schools I attended. Along the way, I earned **several trophies**, as the game came naturally to me and I reached a competitive level. These days, I play badminton casually and have recently taken up basketball as well.
